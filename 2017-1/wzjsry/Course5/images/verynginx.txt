At this point, you have a database and a user account, each made specifically for WordPress. However, these two components have no relationship yet. The user has no access to the database.

Let's fix that by granting our user account access to our database with this command:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO wordpressuser@localhost;
Now the user has access to the database. We need to flush the privileges so that the current instance of MySQL knows about the recent privilege changes we've made:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
We're all set now. We can exit out of the MySQL prompt by typing:

exit
